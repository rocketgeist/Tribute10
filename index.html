        <h2>Rhidale Dotson</h2>

        <h4>
          Rhidale Dotson is the incarcerated leader behind a collection of
          successful gang-reform programs and personal development initiatives
          within the Colorado state prison system. Instead of forcing
          participants to renounce their past and present identities and start
          over from scratch, Rhidale’s approach to change management recognizes
          an individual’s humanity and harnesses his or her existing skills and
          passions to manifest personal growth, with the ultimate goal of
          preparing participants for successful lifestyles and careers in the
          “outside” world. Rhidale’s extensive projects and collaborations have
          been profiled in Westword, and you can read about their origins in his
          own words here. This site serves as a public-facing repository for his
          work.

              “We built GAP from scratch. It was improvised. There were not a
              whole lot of models for us. There was nothing we could find that
              fit our philosophy—to occupy, but not abandon the gang; to empower
              rather than to anesthetize. As a result, our program is not tried
              and proven. But GAP is based on a reality-based strategic plan.
              GAP is based on hope. We think that’s more than enough.“

              We work through horizontal structure where we put our efforts into
              causes, people, and places that we identify as important and where
              we may put our modest and earnest efforts to plant seeds for
              radical change. At a given moment of time, we have members doing
              work to support our unhoused neighbors, using art to raise
              awareness of violence, and creating networks of care to prisons,
              which are epicenters of white supremacist violence.
